##_Version Control with Git_

- [Git] is a version control system, it helps us to systematically store and manage the code we write not only on our own device but also on a remote server.
- It allows us to monitor the status (editing, deleting, adding new files) of the files in our project (except the ones we add to .gitignore), and to develop our project safely without breaking our core code.
- Ideally committing in our project allows us to both see the changes in a healthier way by creating follow-up points and to go to any moment in our project in a possible case.

 _In the simplest terms, Git is a version control system that helps us develop our project systematically and securely._

- [GitHub], on the other hand, is a kind of project storage system where the git system is integrated, where we can see the projects of other developers in the world. We can see our projects that we have integrated git, and the actions we have done with git commands on GitHub.

_It is kind of a social network for developers._
